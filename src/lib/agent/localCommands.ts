/**
 * Tier 1 of the voice architecture: a deterministic phrase match that
 * short-circuits BEFORE the transcribed text ever reaches /api/chat.
 *
 * ⚠ Correction to the original plan: this does NOT make voice work "in
 * airplane mode". Transcription is still a cloud Whisper call
 * (/api/transcribe) — there is no on-device STT in this app, by design (see
 * the architecture plan's cuts). What this tier actually buys is real but
 * narrower: for the highest-frequency commands, it saves the Groq chat call,
 * the RAG retrieval, and their latency and rate-limit cost, by matching on
 * the text Whisper already produced rather than asking a model to interpret
 * it. A network round trip still happened; a second, more expensive one did
 * not.
 *
 * Phrases here are NOT new translations — they are the exact strings already
 * shown on the hub and nav labels (nav.market, hub.soil, etc., from
 * src/lib/i18n/base.ts and mobile.ts). A farmer who can read "ಮಾರುಕಟ್ಟೆ" on
 * the market button saying that exact word is the most natural command
 * there is, and it is vocabulary the app already displays, not something
 * invented for this file. The undo phrases are the one exception — those are
 * carried over from the web repo's accuracy benchmark
 * (agent-farmer/scripts/dryrun/fixtures/phrases.mjs), where they were already
 * measured to transcribe correctly.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT included, with reasons:
 *   - "read this screen" — cut. The only entry point to this router today is
 *     VoiceRoute, reached exclusively by long-pressing the hub's mic. By the
 *     time a command is matched, the current screen IS the voice modal, not
 *     whatever the farmer was looking at before — so "read this screen"
 *     would read the hub, which has nothing worth reading aloud. Revisit once
 *     a screen has its own dictate entry point, not the hub's.
 *   - "stop" — cut. A close (X) button already exists on the voice screen;
 *      true speech barge-in is Phase 4 scope in the architecture plan.
 *   - "change language" — cut deliberately, not just unbuilt. Setting the
 *     WRONG language from a misheard word is a much worse failure than
 *     opening the picker for a manual, safe tap — a farmer locked into a
 *     language they cannot read cannot ask to be un-locked. This one always
 *     routes to the picker screen, never sets a locale directly.

/**
 * Language requests, matched on-device so "only hindi" switches instantly
 * instead of falling through to the model (which used to answer it with the
 * farming disclaimer). This reverses the original "never set language by voice"
 * cut — now made safe because VoiceAgent speaks a confirmation in the NEW
 * language and the language picker is always one tap away to undo.
 *
 * The farmer names a TARGET language, possibly in a different script from the
 * current one, so this table is locale-independent: each language's romanised
 * name plus its own and the Devanagari endonym (the most commonly mixed-in
 * script). Anything this misses still falls through to the server set_language
